NOTE: the package xdg-utils must be installed in order
      to update the MIME types database! It is available
      on most linux distributions, however following there
      is the link to the project home-page:
      http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/

To install the program, open a terminal window and 
cd into the directory containing this file, type then
the following command (without quotes) and press ENTER:

 "python2 ./install.py"
 
If no errors appear then the program is succesfully
installed: the executable will be installed by default
to the directory /usr/local/bin, while the program data
and documentation will be installed by default in /usr/share
and /usr/share/doc

If you want to install the program in a different directory
you have to manually edit the file paths.py located in then
'src' directory or use the '--prefix="DESTINATION-DIRECTORY"'.
For more information type "python2 ./install.py --help".

Finally, you can use the following command (without quotes)
to associate the lxnstack project (*.lxn) with lxnstack:

"xdg-mime default /usr/share/applications/lxnstack.desktop text/lxnproject"

  [4]  EXECUTION
To run the program open a terminal window, type the
following command (without quotes) and press ENTER:

 "lxnstack"
 
and then the program main window will be shown.

  [5]  UNINSTALLATION

Unfortunatly there is no automatic method to uninstall the 
program yet. If you want to remove lxnstack, you must delete
the folder PREFIX/share/lxnstack and its containing and the 
file PREFIX/bin/lxnstack, where PREFIX is the base installation
directory (wich is by default PREFIX=/usr)
